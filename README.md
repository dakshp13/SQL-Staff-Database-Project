# SQL-Staff-Database-Project
A project that uses SQL to create a different databases for departments in a company. These departments have different job types with different employees in them. Furthermore, many queries are show that can be run to change or extract information from the database.

This projects breaks down the companies departments into four major categories including:
HR, Finance, IT, Marketing, and Sales
Each of these is a database in the system that holds four tables for four different types of employees:
full-time, part-time, contractual, intern

The SQL programming language is now used to create these tables under each database and add attributes of the employees
in each one.

Many SQL functions and skills have been used to create this sample database for a company, and there is a section for 
possible queries that can be run to change or extract important information in each database.
